# Investigating the Impact of COVID-19 on New York Cityâ€™s Real Estate Market 
##### Principles of Urban Informatics, NYU CUSP

### Introduction
The pandemic has changed the idea of where city dwellers live and work. With remote work being the norm, people no longer have to travel for work and work out of office buildings. This has resulted in 33% devaluation of office spaces in New York City through 2021. While it is relatively easier to capture the impact of changing work patterns on the real estate market (office spaces are a single determinant), more is needed to encapsulate changing housing needs of people in the city. Anecdotally, it has been observed that people are opting for larger apartments and townhouses to accommodate personal office spaces and other amenities, including gyms, and further away from the business centers, with no obligation to travel to work. Affirming the antecedent and contextualizing it for New York City,  the city should see an increasing number of housing sales in the outer boroughs (the Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Queens), a drastic reduction in subway ridership in Manhattan, and potentially increased socio-economic activities in the outer boroughs among other indicators. To quantifiably put these hypotheses to test, this research attempts to conduct an empirical study to encapsulate the temporal shifts in the housing market before (2017-2019), during the pandemic (2019 - early 2021), and during the recovery process (2021) at a borough level in New York city guided by some pertinent research questions:

1. How have the sale prices (price per sqft.) of residential buildings changed between 2017 and 2021?
2. How have sales volumes (number of buildings sold)  changed between 2017 and 2021? 
3. Does the pandemic (2020) significantly impact the sale prices and sale volumes in the city? Are there any observable patterns?
4. Are all the boroughs impacted similarly, if at all? If not, which borough was impacted most significantly?
5. Did every borough recover at the same rate? If not, which borough(s) stood out?
6. Do the other socio-economic factors (311 building complaints, waste collection complaints, subway ridership) correlate with the housing sales data?
